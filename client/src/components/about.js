Art Notes are little notes you can save for later - when you have the time to "dive" deeper. It is very simple and quick to use - you can use it on your way to work, while doing house chours etc.
You don't have to be an art student or pay for expenssive museums programmes. just browse images and make notes for later out of them. ❦<br/>
<br/>
1. Go to the "Discover" page and get a random artist's work history. Browse his or she's work and save what interested you on the "create Note" page: your personal inputs and/or educational relavant links for later, and the art work's details. 
come back to the list of all art works you saved whenever you need inspiration, or when you have the proper time to read further.<br/>
2. If you already know what artist interests you - write her or his name in the search form in the "Search" page, and browse through their work. If you wish you can, of course, create new notes and save them to your list too.<br/>
We advicen you to add a spotify/goodread list in the personal notes section of every saved art work in your list, and share it  ❦
